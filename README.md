My project was originally supposed to be a casino game called high card flush, but I've never really done web-dev before and ran into a lot of issues with the card shuffling code I used from online, mainly because the shuffling logic of the cards was just reloading the page. I also didn't realize how long connecting the frontend and backend would take, as well as creating a functioning login and account system. So the balance is supposed to show how much you have left and it is saved in a database but balance can't really be used so that part doesn't work either. 

I believe the one part that does work correctly is the account and profile system, except I didn't implement forgot password (sorry!). So you can create an account and see your profile and logout. You also can't access a profile or the shuffler itself without logging in, which is cool I guess. 

I spent around 10 hours in total on this project.

I believe you should just be able to access the project through this link: uth-website.vercel.app
